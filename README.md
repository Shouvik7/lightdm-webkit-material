## A Material design LightDM Webkit2 greeter theme
## [PROJECT ABANDONED]
### You can fork it and develop it according to your tastes.

This is a theme for LightDM Webkit2 (`lightdm-webkit2-greeter`).

Arch Linux users can find it in the AUR: [`lightdm-webkit-theme-material-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lightdm-webkit-theme-material-git/).

### Features

I created this for use on Arch Linux, so it only has the basic features of:

- Selecting an available user from a dropdown
- Entering their password
- Seeing their profile picture
- Restarting the computer
- Shutting the computer down
- Suspending the computer
- Hibernate
- Select session (GNOME, KDE, Xfce or other installed DE)
- Select your language
- 3 different types of background (trianglify, particleground, and image)
- Option to select keyboard layout (eq. pl_PL for Polish keyboard, en_US for English)
- HiDpi screen support (2000px in width or more)
- And the most important thing, A CLOCK WITH SECONDS!!!

### Setting your own user picture

There are a couple of methods you can use to set your user picture in LightDM:

- ~~Put a `jpg` of your face in your home directory as a file called `.face`~~

or

- Add `Icon=/var/lib/AccountsService/icons/<youraccountname>` to the bottom of `/var/lib/AccountsService/users/<youraccountname>` and place a profile image at `/var/lib/AccountsService/icons/<youraccountname>`

### Setting a custom background image

- Put a `jpg` at `/var/lib/AccountsService/wallpapers/lightdm-webkit.jpg` (*You may need to create the wallpapers directory*) and set background engine to image in the settings

### Setting multiple custom background images to pick from

- Put a `jpg` or a `png` in `/var/lib/AccountsService/wallpapers` or in a directory specified by the `background_images` variable in your `/etc/lightdm/lightdm-webkit2-greeter.conf` (either the `greeter` or the `branding` section) and set the background engine to random image in the settings.
